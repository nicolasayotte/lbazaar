Verification & Evidence
- Branch: main
- Tests: php unit test suite green
- Tests: web3/ nodejs test suite green
- Further testing can happen when the frontend is completed

Budget & Scope Alignment
- Milestone delivered within approved scope: difficulties were encountered with regards to supporting credit card payments in a way that is legal in Japan (initial target demographic). For a while it seemed NMKR Pay might not work so we had to look for other options, then it turned out it might be ok. For now we have implemented backend functions with NMKR Pay.

Licensing & Compliance
- Decided on a Open Source licence

Acceptance criteria

Community members can review the source code, which is published on GitHub (open source).

    Database modification to rely on ADA prices rather that points

         (The current database is managed by points, so it should be managed by ADAs.)

    Integrate a wallet that accepts credit card payment for Ada

        （Integrate custodial wallets to accept credit card payments. 

           We will determine the specification details through Milestone１ stakeholder interviews and technical research .)

    Enable NFTs minting for class completion
    Enable tokens minting as rewards
    Unit testing, Manual testing (lead by several dev) and the bug and fix reports will be shared with Community members

For marketing reports, the community has access to a Google Doc, which can be reviewed.

However, including in terms of privacy and other aspects of the organizations that operate

    A summary report on the events held in which we participated, including dates, times, and photos (at least 2 events in a month)
    An anonymous report on which county authorities we approached and what kind of response we received as a result
    Publicize the survey to the community without naming the school
    Publish the name of the municipality that allowed us to conduct the test lessons and the name of the school. 

     At least one local government and a school will be onboarded as a tester by this milestone and the contents will be made by the local  government related organization. (After our platform will be updated on the main domain, we'll update them)

     We'll have meeting with at least two local government to determine how to use our platform for their promotion / their staffs education. (At this stage, gaining paying members is not a priority.  Because at this point in the user experience it is difficult to actually use our platform unless they are quite familiar with Web3 ).

     

With the above, the report is considered to have been fulfilled
